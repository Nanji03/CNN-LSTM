# CNN-LSTM
A hybrid deep learning architecture — CNN-LSTM — for predicting Google’s stock closing prices based on 30-day windows of historical data. Unlike standard LSTMs, this model combines convolutional layers (to extract local temporal patterns) with recurrent LSTM layers (to capture long-term dependencies).
